<h4 align="center"><u>INTRODUCTORY STUDY</u></h4><br>
    <p><u>Memory Verse:</u> <b> Gal. 5:22-23 - <i>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</i></b></p><br> 
    <p><u>Text(s):</u> <b>Matthew 7:15-20</b></p><br>
    
<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b><br>
Christianity is not supposed to be an abstraction. As a seedling planted in the nursery bed, as soon as the Holy Spirit begins to nourish you through the word, prayer and other Christian experience, God expects you to begin to grow.<br><br>
In good time, you are supposed to become a fruitful tree. Jesus Christ made an allusion to this in Matthew 3v10: <i>"And now also the axe is laid into the root of the trees, therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire."</i><br><br>
Jesus amplifies this issue further in John 15v1-2: <i>"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman, every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit."</i> So, fruit bearing is neither doctrinal nor an issue of personal opinion. It is a scriptural phenomenon that goes further to detail out the consequences of its disobedience

</p><br><hr><br>
    
<p><b>THE DIVINE EXPECTATION</b><br>
The divine expectation is that everyone who calls himself a believer has his life already grafted in Jesus Christ who is the true Vine. Based on this assumption, every believer is supposed to be productive effortlessly. The gospel truth is that when the 'production' by the believer becomes labourious, stressful and tiring, it becomes very questionable, if such a believer has actually surrendered his life to Christ. <br><br>
When an electric plug is inserted into a socket carrying current, the plug does not put in any effort to supply current to the iron or whatever electrical appliance that is in use. Power flowing through the plug becomes automatic. Why? It is because the plug is grafted into the socket. No wonder the Scriptures say in Zechariah 4v6: <i>"Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit saith the Lord of Host."</i>


</p><br>
    
<p><b><u>UNDERSTANDING THE WORKS OF THE FLESH - Gal. 5v19-21</u></b><br>
An unbeliever or a carnal believer who has only given a part of his being will live a life of daily struggle between self and Christ. Although he is a card carrying church member or he might even occupy a big position in a particular church but because he is unregenerated and not grafted most of the times, the old self will be winning in this struggle. The result of this self-centred life is a flourish of the works of the flesh.<br><br>
Comparison between works of the flesh and fruit of the Spirit:<br><br>

<br><br>
    Fruit-bearing is the desire of God for every believer but these conditions must be met and it is important to note that there are no short cuts:
</p><br>

<p><br>
<ol>
    <li><b>CONTACT WITH THE LIVING WATER:</b> <br>There is nothing that can be substituted for this. The Scripture says: "But as many as received Him to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name" (John 1v12). Without an encounter with the River of Life, it is NOT possible to bear any useful fruit; because it is by this RIVER that you have the needed power to bear fruit. See Psalm 1v3 
</li>
<li><b>SPIRITUAL RECEPTIVITY:</b> <br> It is very important for your spirit to submit totally to Christ. By total submission to Christ, the ground of your heart is prepared to bear fruits in multiples (Matt. 13v23)</li>
<li><b>THE DEATH OF THE OLD MAN - John 12v24:</b><br> You must die to the old man - the flesh, if you must be a fruit-bearing Christian. Old habits and nature must go (2Cor. 5v17). New habits and characters that glorify God must be cultivated</li>
    <li><b>TAKE A DECISION:</b><br> Every believer has a decision, a choice to make if he is to bear the fruit of righteousness that the Lord expects. To be able to take a decision like the Psalmist who has "chosen the way of truth" and resolved to "run the way of the commandment" requires self examination (Psalm 119v30,32). The search light of the word of God will surely reveal one's standing with the Lord.</li>
<li><b>SEVERE WORLDLY TIES - James 4v4: </b><br>True Christians need to re-examine their relationship with close acquaintances who seek to reduce the impact of the word of God on their lives. Ties that do not improve or deepen your relationship with God but hinder spiritual growth should be severed. Christians who want to bear fruit cannot continue in a friendship that drags to hell. However, if there must be friendship, it must be one which honours the Lord, friendship which helps to run the Christian race to the very end (2Cor. 6v14-18).</li>
<li><b>ABIDING IN CHRIST - John 15v5:</b><br> Fruit-bearing is achieved when Christ is allowed to flow through the branch. Here, the branch is your life. A person may abide in the church- a Nicodemus, may abide in the doctrines of men, in customs and traditions, education, etc. but not in Christ. As long as you do not abide in Christ, you can never bear fruit. No matter how close you are to the altar or any man of God, it is essential to realize that the fruit is a natural product of abiding in the true VINE.</li>
</ol>

</p><br>

<p><b><u>THE DISCIPLINE OF CHRIST</u></b><br>
Following after the discipline of Christ - purging and pruning yourself on a daily basis (John 15v2). The pruning process in the life of a sincere Christian is never an easy one. Pruning implies chastening. Hebrews 12v11: "Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby."<br><br>
Since a Christian life has been likened to a tree, if a tree is not pruned to fit unto the designer's master plan, it may grow branches and leaves that will look beautiful to the outsider but unproductive to the owner. That is why the Scripture says: "My Father is the husband Man" (John 15v1). God is the only One who holds the knife and the pruning shears. Are you always ready for His own pruning or you have a self made design which you are presenting as divine?<br><br>
The issue of fruit-bearing is far more serious than many believers, especially youths, imagine. This is perhaps one of the reasons the unbeliever outside is yet to see God from you. All he sees in you is a name; all he sees are leaves, and cloud without water.<br><br>
But be rest assured that it is one of the greatest satanic manipulations of the last days, to underplay the importance of fruit-bearing and gloss over the works of the flesh, even when seen conspicuously at the altar. The Word of God which cannot change says: "As I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God" (Gal. 5v21). This portion of Scripture has not been exercised and shall not be removed till the day of Judgment. 


</p><br>

<p><b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b><br>
It must be clear in your spirit as we progress in this important study that; your life is your ministry, your confession is your fruit and the fruit you bear is the real testimony of your sonship. Jesus Christ states in Matthew 7v16-17, "Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit". Our Master abhors spiritual barrenness. Check the story of the barren fig tree in Matthew 21v18-21.<br><br>
Finally, you must realize that Christ is not leaving you on your own to go and bear fruit, rather He is willing to help you so that you can bear more fruit and that your fruits may abide in Him (John 15v5; Rom. 6v22).

<h4 align="center"><u>FRUIT BEARING AND THE HOLY SPIRIT
</u></h4><br>
    <p><u>Memory Verse:</u> <b>1 Corinthians 13:2 - <i>"And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing"</b></i></p><br> 
    <p><u>Text(s):</u> <b>1 Cor. 13:1-13 </b></p><br>
    
<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b><br>
In this series of studies, fruit bearing is the central theme of discourse. What is fruit bearing? What are the secrets of fruit bearing and the relationship between fruit bearing and the Holy Spirit?<br><br>
In the first part of this introductory study we established the divine expectation for every believer. Also discussed was the essentiality of being grafted in Christ - abiding in Christ.
</p><br><hr><br>
    
<p><b>WHAT IS ABIDING IN CHRIST? :</b><br>
Abiding in Christ and holding a key position in a church are not synonymous. Part of the essence of this study is for everyone to really put himself under the divine searchlight. A person may be very active in the church and yet not abiding in Christ. The Scripture in Hosea 8v14 says: "For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof".<br><br>
A lot of people operating within the household of God have had their branches severed from the Vine, some through carelessness after the order of Samson, some through greed after the order of Gehazi, some through politics after the order of Absalom and yet many more through deliberate alliance with the powers of darkness. The Scripture says: "Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people..." (Hosea 7v8). Also in Hosea 4v17, it says: "Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone." (see also Hosea 8v11).<br><br>
Abiding in Christ is when you ensure as a believer that NOTHING ever comes in between you as the branch and Christ as the source of your life. This implies an unbroken relationship with Him. This relationship is sustained first by an unwavering faith in what Christ has done for you and what you are in Christ Jesus. You as a believer must always rejoice in the saving grace of Christ and constantly realized that you are redeemed, justified, born into the family of God, a son of the Most High. With this glorious realization indelibly printed on your memory, then you will make an ever increasing earnest endeavor to yield to His abiding Holy Spirit, to obey His command and to walk in His will.
    <br><br>
Before anyone can lay genuine claim to abiding in Christ, he must fulfill these three things:
(1)	Live in the Spirit (Gal. 5v25); <br><br>
(2) Be led by the Spirit (Gal. 5v18); and <br><br>
(3) Walk in the Spirit (Gal. 16, 25). <br><br>
The summation of all these is that you as a believer, are already dead to sin and no longer desirous of vain glory. When people do not give you your 'due' respects, do you feel like cutting off their heads? How do you feel in the innermost recess of your heart? How?


</p><br>
    
<p><b>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT AND THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT</b><br>
A good understanding of these two areas of spiritual blessings is very important for a successful Christian walk here on earth, and to avoid disappointment here after.
The gifts of the Spirit and the Fruit of the Spirit are not the same. One is not a substitute for the other. The gifts have their unique place and functions in the body of Christ while the Fruit also has its own distinct position.<br><br>
The gifts of the Spirit have to do with spiritual capabilities. This is what one can do in the service of the Lord. The Fruit of the Spirit on the other hand has to do with spiritual character. That is, what one is in the Lord. This is the simple and clear biblical truth!<br><br>
The gifts are received consequent upon the baptism of the Holy Ghost (Joel 2v 28-30), whereas the Fruit is a result of salvation and abiding in Christ. The gifts are received instantaneously while the Fruit develops gradually. There are varieties of gifts but there is only one Fruit of the Spirit. The list in Gal. 5v22-23, are the nine characteristics of the Fruit of the Spirit - Love. All the virtues mentioned are different faces of Love (1Cor. 13). The first three concern our attitude toward God, the second triad deals with social relationships, and the third group describes principles that guide a Christian's conduct.<br><br>
The Gifts of the Spirit concern the things one does in the service of the Lord, whereas the Fruit of the Spirit is the way, the how, one does those things he is doing in the service of God.

</p><br>

<p><b>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT AND FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT</b><br>
While the gifts of the Spirit is different from the Fruit of the Spirit, yet, the two are still extremely related and are in fact 'one'.
No adjustment can be made to the Scripture on what Apostle Paul talked extensively on, the futility and profitlessness of exercising spiritual gifts without incubating same in the Fruit of the Spirit. In fact, Apostle Paul goes far as saying that in God's own calculation, exercising gifts without fruit is NOTHIING.<br><br>
Therefore, it is essential to inscribe it inside our spirit that all gifts must be exercised with the Fruit of the Spirit - Love. It must be understood that the Ministry of the gifts of the Spirit accompanied by the fruit of the Spirit is of great power and usefulness in the work of the Lord. This, unfortunately is what Saul though, a prophet, (1Sam. 10v10-11) could not combine together.<br><br>
The same inability was also the error of Balaam (Num. 22-27). It is sad but true that the same thing is still being repeated in many lives today. May God help us!
The Holy Spirit is as much interested in character as He is in power. Therefore, the development of the inner nature of Christ-like characters must be behind any use of spiritual gifts.

</p><br>

<p><b><u>QUESTION</u></b><br>
Can you truly say you are abiding in Christ based on the exposition in this study?

</p><br>

<p><b><u>PRAYER POINTS</u></b><br>
My life shall not follow after the order of Saul, in the Name of Jesus.

<h4 align="center"><u>JOY</u></h4><br>
    <p><u>Memory Verse:</u> <i><b>Romans 14:17 - "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</b></i></p><br> 
    <p><u>Text(s):</u> <b>Neh. 8:8-10; Isa. 12:3-6</b></p><br>
    
<p><b><u>WHAT IS JOY?</u></b><br>
Joy is the natural heart feeling of a true believer to God's mercies, blessings and benefits. It is a gift of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and is one of the principal consequences of true salvation. Joy is almost inseparable from gladness and heartfelt or innermost feeling (Matt. 5v12; Luke 1v14, 47; John 7v38). Joy is one of the fruit of the Spirit that shows in our character towards God. Joy in the Holy Ghost is the symbol of our attitude towards God.</p><br><hr><br>
    
<p><b>TRUE JOY</b><br>
Joy can spring up from several sources, but true joy can come from only one source. True joy is God-induced, God-sowed and God-centred <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>God Himself is the Author of real joy (1Thess. 3v9).</li>
        <li>True joy is a divine gift from God to His children (Rom. 15v13).</li>
        <li>True joy has God as its Object (Psalm 9v2; 33v21; Joel 2v23).</li>
        <li>True joy is sacred since it is God-induced rather than man-centred (John 16v22).</li>
        <li>True joy is glorious for it is from heaven (1Pet. 1v8).</li>
        <li>True joy is everlasting (Isa. 35v10; 51v11).</li>
    </ul>
</p><br>
    
<p><b>WRONG JOY</b><br>
All other joy not sourced from God is fake, temporal and unreliable. Many things present themselves as sources of joy but in fact (and sadly too) they are sources of woes and torments. These include wealth, educational attainments, positions in life, connections, etc. Lots of these fake religions and occult groups promised joy but instead all they deliver to their believers are sorrows and disappointments. Through the clever device of Satan, many people have pursued fake joy all of their lives. Some discovered at the twilight of their lives that the ladder of their lives have been placed on a wrong wall, all along.<br><br>
Spiritual prowess in itself, Jesus Christ warned, must never be the source of a believer's joy (Luke 10v 17-20). Demons trembling or witchcraft manifestations at our meetings should not be the source of our joy but rather because we are sons and daughters of God. Anyone who is making this diversion the source of his or her joy is heading for spiritual shipwreck (Exo. 32v32; Dan. 12v1; Rev. 22v19).

</p><br>

<p><b>IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JOY AND HAPPINESS?</b><br>
There's no explicit difference between happiness and joy. Both involve the emotions, both are pleasurable feelings, and both are mentioned in Scripture in passages that equate the two. <br><br>
A dictionary definition of happiness is "A state of well-being; a pleasurable or satisfying experience." A definition of the word 'rejoice', related to the word 'joy', is "To feel great delight; to be glad." Depending on the translation, the Bible uses the word 'happy' and 'happiness' about 30 times, while 'joy' and 'rejoice' appear over 300 times.<br><br>
Jeremiah 31v13 says: "I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow." Here, in the parallelism of the Hebrew poetry, the words gladness and joy are used synonymously. And Proverbs 23v25 says: "Let your father and your mother be glad... And let her rejoice who gave birth to you." Being glad is the same thing as rejoicing in this verse. Unless we are willing to say that gladness and happiness are completely different things, then we must say that joy and happiness are linked.<br><br>
It is common today to hear believers speak of a difference between joy and happiness. The teaching usually makes the following points: <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Happiness is a feeling but joy is not.</li>
        <li>Happiness is fleeting but joy is everlasting.</li>
        <li>Happiness depends on circumstances or other people but joy is a gift from God.</li>
        <li>Happiness is worldly but joy is divine. But there's no such distinctions made in Scriptures, and forcing a distinction between two words that are so obviously close in meaning is unnecessary.</li>
    </ul>
 
<br><br>
If a person is joyful, then he or she is happy. There's no such thing as glum joy. We cannot drain joy of emotion and still call it "joy". When God's Spirit gives us joy, then we are happy people. Christians should be joyful; happiness should characterise our everyday lives and it should be experienced too.<br><br>
James 1v2 says: "Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials." Christians can be happy, even in the midst of difficulties because we know "the testing of our faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing"(verses 3-4). As we persevere through trials, with God's help, our faith strengthens and matures. By God's grace we can be happy despite our circumstances.<br><br>
Joy is often presented as "true" contentment based on faith. Happiness, in contrast, is often thought of as "false" or "superficial" emotion dependent on circumstances. But this is a false dichotomy. There is nothing in the Bible that suggests we divorce happiness from joy. The two are equal.<br><br>
Of course, there are different types of joy and happiness. There is a joy that comes from the world, such as "the fleeting pleasures of sin" spoken of in Hebrews 11v25. There is a joy that is part of the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5v22). There is a temporary happiness and an eternal happiness, but we can call both "happiness." We don't need to split hairs between the meaning of joy and happiness. We just need to decide where our joy comes from. Are we happy in the Lord, or are we content with the happiness the world affords?<br><br>
Solomon tried the world's brand of happiness and found it to be lacking (Eccl. 2v1-2). The joy of the world is hollow but the joy of the Lord is rich and abundant. The world's happiness will fade with time but God's people will be happy forever (Isa. 35v10).


</p><br>

<p><b>JOY AS A SUBSTANCE</b><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Joy has levels - (John 15v11). These things I have spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full (see also John 17v13).</li>
        <li>Joy needs to be guarded from being stolen - (John 16v22). Part of the eternal strategy of Satan is to con people to trade off their true joy for ephemeral things.</li>
        
    </ul>

</p><br>

<p><b>OBSTACLES TO FULLNESS OF JOY</b><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Consciously living in sin - (Psalm 51v3, 9, 12; 1John 1v1-7).</li>
        <li>Unbelief - (Phil. 1v25; 1Pet. 1v6-7).</li>
        <li>Neglect of prayer - (John 16v24).</li>
        <li>Disobedience - (John 15v10-11).</li>
        <li>Grieving the Holy Spirit - (Eph. 4v30).</li>
        <li>Seeking after other gods/ backsliding - (Psalm 16v4).</li>

<p><b>THE FINAL JOY - (Heb. 12v2)</b><br>

    All the joy man experiences on earth are for a season. However, there's another joy beyond the river, across the bridge where sorrow can never inter-lace. This joy is reserved only for those who will hold on till the end. The ultimate for every Christian is to be a part of this final joy (Rev. 7v17; 21v4).
</p><br>

<p><b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b><br>
Christian joy is made available to every believer. You and I must also live our Christian lives under the full consciousness that our arch enemy is always at the corner waiting to steal our joy. He is that power that propels stormy gale and the attendant frustration that blows against our joy.<br><br>
We thank God that His desire for us is for His joy to remain permanent in us.

</p><br>

<p><b><u>QUESTION</u></b><br>
What is the basis of your joy?

</p><br>

<p><b><u>PRAYER POINTS</u></b><br>
Let joy like a river begin to flow in my heart now, in the Name of Jesus.

	<h4 align="center"><u>PEACE</u></h4><br>
    <p><u>Memory Verse:</u> <i><b>Ephesians 2:14 - "For God so loved the world...</b></i></p><br> 
    <p><u>Text(s):</u> <b>Psalm 23</b></p><br>
    
<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b><br>
The Bible uses the word peace in several different ways. For example, in the Old Testament, the primary Hebrew word for "peace" is shalom, and it refers to relationships between people, nations (1Kings 5v12). It also refers to a state of friendship between God and man (Psalm 85v8). <br><br>
In the New Testament, the primary Greek word for "peace" is eirene, and it refers to rest and tranquillity. A key focus of peace in the New Testament is the advent of Jesus Christ, as announced by the angels in Luke 2v14 ("Peace on earth..."). This peace between a holy God and sinful mankind has been effected by Christ's sacrificial death, "having made peace through the blood of His cross" (Col. 1v20). In addition, as High Priest, the Lord Jesus maintains that state of friendship on behalf of all who continue to "come to God by Him, seeing He always lives to make intercession for them" (Heb. 7v25). This state of friendship with God is a prerequisite for the second kind of peace, that which sometimes refers to a tranquil mind. It is only when "we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 5v1) that we can experience the true peace of mind that is a fruit of the Holy Spirit, in other words, His fruit exhibited in us (Gal. 5v22).
</p><br><hr><br>
    
<p><b><u>DEFINITION OF PEACE</u></b><br>
A word often translated "peace" in the Bible actually means "to tie together as a whole, when all essential parts are joined together." Peace is freedom from all forms of disturbance and a state of quietness. It is the most prized possession of Christians and was held out as a veritable evidence of our reconciliation with God through Christ (Rom. 5v1).<br><br>
Peace to the believers is not so much as the absence of things that tear hearts apart like war, famine, economic downturns, misfortunes and tragedies, as the composure and calm in the face of such calamities through the presence of the Holy Spirit working within. So, peace is not the absence of trouble; it is the presence of God.
</p><br>
    
<p><b>FACTORS THAT THREATEN PEACE</b><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Fear - John 14v1; 1John 4v18.</li>
        <li>Worry and anxiety - Matt. 6v31, 32.</li>
        <li>Sin - Prov. 13v15; Isa. 48v22; 57v20, 21.</li>
        <li>Guilty conscience - Gen. 3v8; 4v6, 7.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <br>
    God expects us to anchor our souls upon His words and draw from the provision of the cross to fortify ourselves against forces that rob man of his peace.
</p><br>

<p><b>FACTORS THAT PROMOTE ALL-ROUND PEACE</b><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Avoid unhealthy competition, especially in the church of God - Eph. 4v3; Rom. 12v14-18; 1Pet. 3v8-11; Col. 3v13.</li>
        <li>Unity, tolerance and endurance - Psalm 133; Eph. 4v2. Where there is suspicion and distrust, war is inevitable. </li>
        <li>Love and forgiveness - Col. 3v13; 1Pet. 4v8; Luke 11v25-26; Matt. 5v13-24.</li>
        <li>Contentment (not complacency) - 1Tim. 6v6.</li>
        <li>Knowledge of the word of God - Psalm 85v8. Once one knows exactly what the word of God is saying about a situation, there will be calmness and confidence, except in the case of willful disobedience.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
</p><br>

<p><b>DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEACE</b><br>

    <ul>
        <li>False Peace (1Thess. 5v3) - of the godless rich (Psalm 73v18, 19; Rev. 3v17); of religious sinners (Luke 13v1-3); of the wicked (Prov. 10v28; Isa. 47v8-11); of the world political order, based on brilliant initiatives, peace agreements and contentions, with the superpowers seeming global co-operation, as co-ordinated by United Nations (Dan. 2v40-43; 1Thess. 5v3).</li>
        <li>Inner Peace - Inner peace comes from knowing that circumstances are temporary and that God is sovereign over all (Isa. 46v9-11). Inner peace resulting from a relationship with God allows us to keep things in proper perspectives. We can accept difficult situations on earth by remembering that our citizenship is in heaven (Philp. 3v20).</li>
        <li>Peace with God - (Rom. 5v1; Col. 1v20).</li>
        <li>Peace with Man - We are commanded to "live in peace" with others, as far as it is up to us (Rom. 12v18; 2Cor. 13v11; Heb. 12v14). To live at peace means we interact with those around us in accordance with our own wholeness of mind. Our reaction to circumstances can bring peace to an otherwise chaotic situation. Jesus said: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God" (Matt. 5v9). And James 3v18 says: "Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness". God's desire is that we who know Him learn to live in peace within ourselves first. Then we can radiate that peace to others, bringing calmness and order to tense situations and in so doing, be lights in the world (Matt. 5v14; Philp. 2v14-15).</li>
                
    </ul>
</p><br>

<p><b>HOW TO FIND PEACE </b><br>

    <ul>
        <li>By accepting the Lord Jesus as Saviour and Lord - there can be no peace with God until a person knows and accepts Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace as his personal Saviour from sin (Rom. 5v1).</li>
        <li>By trusting God - Believers have an obligation to "let the peace of God rule" in their hearts. This means we have the choice either to trust God's promises (letting His peace rule) or to rely on ourselves and reject the peace He offers. Isaiah 26v3: "Thou will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee: because he trusteth in Thee." Peace comes by committing all those anxieties unto God for solution.</li>
        <li>By seeking and ensuring peace - Rom. 5v1; 1Pet. 3v11. Follow peace with all men (Heb. 12v14) in the neighbourhood, family, church, working place, etc.</li>
        <li>Read the word of God always - Psalm 85v8.</li>
        <li>Pray for peace always - Peace is experienced as a result of prayer. "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus" (Philp. 4v6-7).</li>
        <li>By prompt obedience to the institution/commandment of God (Isa. 48v18). Never argue with God on His word. Believe God and His word. Carry it out immediately; thereby shall peace come to you. A peaceful mind and heart are experienced as a result of recognizing that an all-wise and loving Father has a purpose in our trials. "We know that all things work together for good to those who love God and are called according to His purpose" (Rom. 8v28).</li>
                
    </ul>
</p><br>
    


<p><b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b><br>
Isaiah 26v3 tells us that God will keep us in "prefect peace" if our minds are "stayed" on Him, meaning our minds lean on Him. Our tranquility of mind is "perfect" or "imperfect" to the degree that the "mind is stayed on" God rather than ourselves or on our problems. Peace is experienced as we believe what the Bible says about God's nearness as in Psalm 139v1-12, and about His goodness and power, His mercy and love for His children, and His sovereignty over all of life's circumstances. But we can't trust someone we don't know and it is crucial, therefore, to come to know immediately the Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ.<br><br>
The world cannot know peace except it allows the Prince of Peace to man its affairs. The theory of universal peace will thus remain an illusion while all the promises of achievements along this line will become empty and baseless.<br><br>
However, there is sure provision for the church and individuals within her to rise above the problems of our present world as we enthrone Jesus and make Him the Lord of our lives. "These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world, ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16v33).


</p><br>

<p><b><u>QUESTION</u></b><br>
What do you understand by 'the peace I give unto you is not as the world gives'?

</p><br>

<p><b><u>PRAYER POINTS</u></b><br>
Every enemy of my peace, be disgraced, in the Name of Jesus.
